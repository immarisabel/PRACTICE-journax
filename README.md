# My Ambitious Journal Project: JOURNAX
JournaX
*My universal personal experience journal*

Beautiful and Inspiring!

__GOAL: To learn the ins and outs of database-supported software and have the digital journal of my dreams.__

### Concept:
I have been an avid journal writer since I can remember. A few years ago I bought a subscription to Journey.App and I love it. However, I have always dreamed of having all of my journals (my dream journal is on a different service as my stories and so on) on my own portable and offline app. But most offline journal apps are just u-g-l-y. I could use a notepad but that eventually gets boring.

I want to collect all my memories in a single USB drive (or 2 for BU) instead of spread them around in different services.

### WHAT I WISH TO HAVE

1. simplified journal writing on the same window
2. markup language use which I can also edit to my own colors (like CSS: if bold, then pink IE)
3. Multiple journals with their own separate tags and categories 
	- a. Dream Journal with categories of dreams
	- b. Personal Journal with maybe mood categories
	- c. Daily Log
	- d. Food journal with also categories maybe for scoring
	- e. language learning journal
	- f. general notes and ideas with categories
4. Trackers
	- a. Customised trackers to register any value like booleans, integers, and text. I kept this in a google sheet. But want to have it also included in the journal
		- Movies watched (text)
		- Weight tracker (Double)
		- Habits (Booleans)
	- b. charts according to what I am tracking
5. Reminders
	- a. birthdays
	- b. last time I... (IE: haircut)
	- c. big events quick note

###	LONG TERM GOALS
- learning SQL through and through
- learning to compile with SQLite (as I require multiple tables)
- learning to manipulate tables and data via input on Java
- ~~learning JavaFX (via the Udemy course which has a 20-hour [out of 80] section :scream: )~~ Will try Spring when I learn enough.
- learning to implement all of this and run my own custom made journal via a USB
- learning API integration for things like the weather or spellchecker based on the computer's own options

#### JAN 4 - 10, 2021:
first week
#### FEB 17 2021: 
It has been over a month. I learned a lot about SQL and other Java concepts like OOO. Doing some work on the code to manipulate the SQL and dividing into their own classes before implementing any improvements.
#### JUN 2021:
tried to implement LOGIN/LOCK journal methods
